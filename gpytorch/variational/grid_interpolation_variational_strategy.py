class GridInterpolationVariationalStrategy(_VariationalStrategy):
    r"""
    This strategy constrains the inducing points to a grid and applies a deterministic
    relationship between :math:`\mathbf f` and :math:`\mathbf u`.
    It was introduced by `Wilson et al. (2016)`_.

    Here, the inducing points are not learned. Instead, the strategy
    automatically creates inducing points based on a set of grid sizes and grid
    bounds.

    :param ~gpytorch.models.ApproximateGP model: Model this strategy is applied to.
        Typically passed in when the VariationalStrategy is created in the
        __init__ method of the user defined model.
    :param int grid_size: Size of the grid
    :param list grid_bounds: Bounds of each dimension of the grid (should be a list of (float, float) tuples)
    :param ~gpytorch.variational.VariationalDistribution variational_distribution: A
        VariationalDistribution object that represents the form of the variational distribution :math:`q(\mathbf u)`
