class ProductStructureKernel(Kernel):
    r"""
    A Kernel decorator for kernels with product structure. If a kernel decomposes
    multiplicatively, then this module will be much more computationally efficient.

    A kernel function `k` has product structure if it can be written as

    .. math::

       \begin{equation*}
          k(\mathbf{x_1}, \mathbf{x_2}) = k'(x_1^{(1)}, x_2^{(1)}) * \ldots * k'(x_1^{(d)}, x_2^{(d)})
       \end{equation*}

    for some kernel :math:`k'` that operates on each dimension.

    Given a `b x n x d` input, `ProductStructureKernel` computes `d` one-dimensional kernels
    (using the supplied base_kernel), and then multiplies the component kernels together.
    Unlike :class:`~gpytorch.kernels.ProductKernel`, `ProductStructureKernel` computes each
    of the product terms in batch, making it very fast.

    See `Product Kernel Interpolation for Scalable Gaussian Processes`_ for more detail.

    Args:
        - :attr:`base_kernel` (Kernel):
            The kernel to approximate with KISS-GP
        - :attr:`num_dims` (int):
            The dimension of the input data.
        - :attr:`active_dims` (tuple of ints, optional):
            Passed down to the `base_kernel`.
