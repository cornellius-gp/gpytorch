GPyTorch is a Gaussian process library implemented using PyTorch. GPyTorch is designed for creating scalable, flexible, and modular Gaussian process models with ease.

Internally, GPyTorch differs from many existing approaches to GP inference by performing most inference operations using numerical linear algebra techniques like preconditioned conjugate gradients.
Implementing a scalable GP method is as simple as providing a matrix multiplication routine with the kernel matrix and its derivative via our [LinearOperator](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/linear_operator) interface,
or by composing many of our already existing `LinearOperators`.
This allows not only for easy implementation of popular scalable GP techniques,
but often also for significantly improved utilization of GPU computing compared to solvers based on the Cholesky decomposition.

GPyTorch provides (1) significant GPU acceleration (through MVM based inference);
(2) state-of-the-art implementations of the latest algorithmic advances for scalability and flexibility ([SKI/KISS-GP](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/wilson15.pdf), [stochastic Lanczos expansions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03481), [LOVE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06058.pdf), [SKIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08903.pdf), [stochastic variational](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00336.pdf) [deep kernel learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/wilson16.pdf), ...);
(3) easy integration with deep learning frameworks.


## Examples, Tutorials, and Documentation

See our [**documentation, examples, tutorials**](https://gpytorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on how to construct all sorts of models in GPyTorch.

## Installation

**Requirements**:
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.11

Install GPyTorch using pip or conda:

```bash
pip install gpytorch
conda install gpytorch -c gpytorch
```

(To use packages globally but install GPyTorch as a user-only package, use `pip install --user` above.)

#### Latest (Unstable) Version

To upgrade to the latest (unstable) version, run

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/cornellius-gp/linear_operator.git
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch.git
```

#### Development version

If you are contributing a pull request, it is best to perform a manual installation:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch.git
cd gpytorch
pip install -e .[dev,docs,examples,keops,pyro,test]  # keops and pyro are optional
```

#### ArchLinux Package
**Note**: Experimental AUR package. For most users, we recommend installation by conda or pip.

GPyTorch is also available on the [ArchLinux User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository) (AUR).
You can install it with an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers), like [`yay`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/), as follows:

```bash
yay -S python-gpytorch
```
To discuss any issues related to this AUR package refer to the comments section of
[`python-gpytorch`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-gpytorch/).
