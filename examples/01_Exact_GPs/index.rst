Exact GPs (Regression)
========================

Regression with a Gaussian noise model is the cannonical example of Gaussian processes.
These examples will work for small to medium sized datasets (~2,000 data points).
All examples here use exact GP inference.

- `Simple GP Regression`_ is the basic tutorial for regression in GPyTorch.
- `Spectral Mixture Regression`_ extends on the previous example with a more complex kernel.
- `Fully Bayesian GP Regression`_ demonstrates how to perform fully Bayesian inference by sampling the GP hyperparameters
  using NUTS. (This example requires Pyro to be installed).
