    "# GP Regression (CUDA) with Fast Predictive Distributions (LOVE)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate that LOVE (the method for fast variances and sampling introduced in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06058 and the `fast_variances_ski_LOVE.ipynb`) can significantly reduce the cost of computing predictive distributions with exact GPs too. This can be especially useful in settings like small-scale Bayesian optimization, where predictions need to be made at enormous numbers of candidate points, but there aren't enough training examples to necessarily warrant the use of sparse GP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will train an exact GP on the `skillcraft `UCI dataset, and then compare the time required to make predictions with each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The timing results reported in the paper compare the time required to compute (co)variances __only__. Because excluding the mean computations from the timing results requires hacking the internals of GPyTorch, the timing results presented in this notebook include the time required to compute predictive means, which are not accelerated by LOVE. Nevertheless, as we will see, LOVE achieves impressive speed-ups."
